# Backend

This folder contains the backend of the project, developed with **Python (FastAPI)**.

### What goes here:
- `src/` → source code (controllers, models, routes, services, database).
- `tests/` → automated tests with pytest.
- `requirements.txt` → backend dependencies.
- `main.py` → application entry point.
